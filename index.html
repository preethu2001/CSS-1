    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stand for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><span class="item-third">CSS is not neccesary </span><span class="item-four">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web page all at once</li><br>
        <li class="item-five">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep to the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="item-six">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </span>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
        style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one
        unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
        link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
        elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
        of styles can be applied to the element.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commnly used
        are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should
        be applied.
